# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO //Phillies Notifier 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO   The program will be able to retrieve upcoming Phillies game schedules and display the game start times in the user's preferred time zone.  Better outcome: The program will be able to provide additional game information such as opponent team, game location, and game results if the game is in progress or finished.  Best outcome: The program will
have a user-friendly interface, allowing the user to set preferences such as notification times and preferred time zones. The program will also have the ability
to send notifications to the user's email or phone.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The Phillies Notifier program will have the following features:  Retrieve data from the MLB's API to obtain
Phillies game schedules Notify the user of upcoming Phillies games and their start times through a command-line interface Provide additional
information such as opponent team, location of the game, and game results if the game is in progress or finished Allow the user to set preferences such as notification times and preferred time zones
The program will be executed through a command-line interface and will use
Python libraries such as Requests and JSON to retrieve data from the MLB's API. The program will also use the datetime library to handle time zones and provide accurate game start times to the user.  
TODO


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
The program will be able to retrieve upcoming Phillies game schedules and display
the game start times in the user's preferred time zone. 
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final 
project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Better outcome: The program will be able to provide additional game
information such as the opponent team, game location, and game results if the game
is in progress or finished. 


TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Best outcome: The program will have a user-friendly interface, allowing the user to set preferences such as
notification times 



## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
